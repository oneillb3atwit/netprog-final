# TODO list

* Fix collision detection
* Add swing functionality
* Lower packet size by ditching JSON?
* Detect and handle lost connection on client and server sides (add team
  balancing too maybe?)
* Server and port as optional command line argument
* Main menu with options to host or connect to a different server
* Generalize objects more so it is easier to implement different games using
  this as a framework
